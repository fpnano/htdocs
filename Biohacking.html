            "Biohacking is a global movement based on the idea that you can change the environment 
    around you and inside of you so you have full control of your own biology,
    ” says Dave Asprey, author of Smarter, Not Harder: The Biohacker’s 
    Guide to Getting the Body and Mind You Want. For most people,
     “control” means a desire to be better, not just okay, he shared during the
      2023 national Biohacking Conference in Orlando, Florida.
In Asprey’s case, he was once seriously overweight and struggling with brain fog 
and chronic fatigue while working in Silicon Valley. His journey with what’s 
now called biohacking began when he decided to apply the principles of being a 
computer tech-hacker to his own personal biology instead.
“Hackers look at something they want to [access], and they don’t know what it is,
 but they start poking at it until they get the behavior they want, and then they 
 gain control of the system by changing the way they get in,” he explains.
Asprey regularly shares how his hacking philosophy led him to extensive personal
 experimentation, including taking dozens of daily supplements and injecting his 
 own bone marrow-harvested stem cells into various joints in his body. Healthy and full of energy, 
 he now says he plans to live to 180 years old.
